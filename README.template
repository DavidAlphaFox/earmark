Pull Requests are happily accepted.

Please be aware of one _caveat_ when correcting/improving `README.md`.

The `README.md` is generated by the mix task `readme` from `README.template` and
docstrings by means of `%moduledoc` or `%functiondoc` directives.

Please identify the origin of the generated text you want to correct and then
apply your changes there.

Then issue the mix task `readme`, this is important to have a correctly updated `README.md` after the merge of
your PR.

Thank you.
